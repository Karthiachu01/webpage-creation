# webpage-creation
A webpage is created using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. HTML defines elements like headings, paragraphs, and images, while CSS controls the appearance such as colors, fonts, and layout. You write the code in a text editor (like VS Code), save it with a .html extension, and open it in a browser to view it. Images and content are added using HTML tags, and the design is improved with CSS. Itâ€™s the basic way to build personal sites, portfolios, or project pages.
